# Display  Backend

**This repository is now part of https://github.com/alarmdisplay/display**

This component is the connection point for all Display units.
While it maintains a [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) connection with the Displays to push updates, it also offers a REST API to manage the Displays and their contents.

## Development
In order to run a development version on your local system, you need a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) environment and a MariaDB instance.
Clone the repository and run `npm install` inside the project folder to install all the dependencies.
Create a file called `development.json` in the `config/` folder, which lets you override single properties of `config/default.json`.
At minimum, you will need the `mysql` property to set up the database connection.

Start the development server by running `npm run dev`, it will automatically restart when files have changed.
Now you can access the server on http://localhost:3031.
